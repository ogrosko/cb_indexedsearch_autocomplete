============

1. You need to have indexed search up and running (obviously).
2. Install the extension via the Extension Manager.
3. If you want the AutoComplete feature enabled on custom searchboxes (Such as Macina etc.) then add “Indexed Search AutoComplete” to the “Include static (from extensions)” field in your template. :sup:`1 <#sdfootnote1sym>`_
4. Go to the page on your site where the Indexed Search plugin is placed and start typing in the search field.
5. You can change the color and other visual settings in the css file (/res/cb_indexedsearch_autocomplete.css) or load your own css file (recommended). You may disable the standard css file by cssLoadedExternally in your TS constants/setup.
6. You can set in Constants Editor the “noConflictMethod” to avoid conflicts with other Extension based on JavaScript
